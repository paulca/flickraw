= Flickraw

Flickraw is a library to access flickr[http://flickr.com] api in a simple way.
It maps exactly the methods described in {the official api documentation}[http://www.flickr.com/services/api].
It also tries to present the data returned in a simple and intuitive way.
The methods are fetched from flickr when loading the library by using introspection capabilities. So it is always up-to-date with regards to new methods added by flickr.

The rubyforge project : http://rubyforge.org/projects/flickraw

The github repository: http://github.com/hanklords/flickraw/tree/master

= Installation
Type this in a console (you might need to be superuser)
 gem install flickraw

This will recreate the documentation by fetching the methods descriptions from flickr and then virtually plugging them in standard rdoc documentation.
 rake rdoc

= Features

* Small single file: flickraw.rb is less than 300 lines
* Complete support of flickr API. This doesn't require an update of the library
* Ruby syntax similar to the flickr api
* Flickr authentication
* Photo upload
* Proxy support
* Delayed library loading (for rails users)

= Usage

== Simple

 require 'flickraw'

 list   = flickr.photos.getRecent

 id     = list[0].id
 secret = list[0].secret
 info = flickr.photos.getInfo :photo_id => id, :secret => secret

 info.title           # => "PICT986"
 info.dates.taken     # => "2006-07-06 15:16:18"


 sizes = flickr.photos.getSizes :photo_id => id

 original = sizes.find {|s| s.label == 'Original' }
 original.width       # => "800"

== Authentication

  require 'flickraw'

  FlickRaw.api_key="... Your API key ..."
  FlickRaw.shared_secret="... Your shared secret ..."

  frob = flickr.auth.getFrob
  auth_url = FlickRaw.auth_url :frob => frob, :perms => 'read'

  puts "Open this url in your process to complete the authication process : #{auth_url}"
  puts "Press Enter when you are finished."
  STDIN.getc

  begin
    flickr.auth.getToken :frob => frob
    login = flickr.test.login
    puts "You are now authenticated as #{login.username}"
  rescue FlickRaw::FailedResponse => e
    puts "Authentication failed : #{e.msg}"
  end

You don't need to do that each time, you can reuse your token:

  require 'flickraw'

  FlickRaw.api_key="... Your API key ..."
  FlickRaw.shared_secret="... Your shared secret ..."

  auth = flickr.auth.checkToken :auth_token => "... Your saved token ..."

  # From here you are logged:
  puts auth.user.username

== Upload

  require 'flickraw'

  FlickRaw.api_key="... Your API key ..."
  FlickRaw.shared_secret="... Your shared secret ..."

  PHOTO_PATH='photo.jpg'

  # You need to be authentified to do that, see the previous examples.
  flickr.upload_photo PHOTO_PATH, :title => "Title", :description => "This is the description"

== Flickraw Options

You can pass some options to modify flickraw behavior:

  FlickrawOptions = {
    :lazyload => true,     # This delay the loading of the library until the first call

    # Proxy support. alternatively, you can use the http_proxy environment variable
    :proxy_host => "proxy_host",
    :proxy_port => "proxy_port",
    :proxy_user => "proxy_user",
    :proxy_password => "proxy_password",

    :timeout => 5          # Set the request timeout
  }
  require 'flickraw'


See the _examples_ directory to find more examples.

= Notes
If you want to use the api authenticated with several user at the same time, you must pass the authentication token explicitely each time.
This is because it is keeping the authentication token internally.
As an alternative, you can create new Flickr objects besides Kernel.flickr which is created for you. Use Flickr.new to this effect.
